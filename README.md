# donttouchyourface

A quick summary of what I did:

Step 1- I created a small dataset which contains images of my face and hands
Step 2- Trained a YOLOv3 model using the dataset
Step 3- After 3 hours of training, the model learned to detect and localize my face and hands in an image
Step 4- I used the AWS Polly speech synthesis tool to create a few funny audio files to warn my self
Step 5- Finally, I created a Python script that captures images from my webcam uses the pre-trained model for inference and warns me if my hand gets too close to my face
